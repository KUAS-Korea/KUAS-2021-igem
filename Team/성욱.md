As it was in 2020, 2021 was an extremely difficult year to work with our members. Due to social distancing policies in South Korea which only permits gatherings under 5 people, we coudn't have a single offline meeting. Due to this difficulty, we struggled a lot in keeping the project running. Actually, it was my first time that I stood up to lead a team of such size, so I was very commited to this project. However, being a leader turned out to be very difficult. Commitment and hard work was not enough. What turns out to be more important is encouraging members to engage in dicussions by creating a friendly environment for communication. But online meetings were just not a suitable for this purpose. It filtered out all the non verbal froms of communication which is crucial in delivering the sense of belonging and welcomness. At the end of the day, I think it was a valuable experience which taught me a lesson on what it takes to be a leader. I'd like to thank the members for trying hard despite the difficult circumstances. And I hope things get better in 2022.
