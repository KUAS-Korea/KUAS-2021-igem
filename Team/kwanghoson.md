This year, our iGEM team has decided to treat frogs' disease as the project theme. As a specific design plan for the subject, AND gate, surface expression system, and light detection system were proposed. This year, I was able to build knowledge of these biological systems by conducting parts design using benchling and matlab-based modeling.
Similar to last year, offline meetings were not easy because there were social distancing restrictions implemented by COVID-19, but I think I was able to have a good experience by working hard on the project while conducting possible activities online.
I have participated in iGEM projects on different topics over the past three years. Each project had a different theme and direction, so I was able to do various kinds of work. I'm sure these wonderful experiences I got from working on the iGEM projects will help me decide what kind of dreams I'll have in the future.
