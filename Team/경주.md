Bio
Major: life science
Catchphrase: grind hard, shine hard
Greeting: There were many difficulties due to restrictions on meeting team members online, but I was able to think a lot about synthetic biology for two years. Thank you to all the team members and I hope we can prepare hard for the rest of the year and get good results.
