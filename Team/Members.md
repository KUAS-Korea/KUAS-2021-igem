Kyeongmin Kim (Human Practice Team Leader)
"Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate!"
: It was a valuable time to grow further on my own while preparing for iGEM following last year. Looking back on our team's strong passion and efforts, I am proud to be a synthetic biologist who contributes to society.
