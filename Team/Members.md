"Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate!"
: It was a valuable time to grow further on my own while preparing for iGEM following last year. Looking back on our team's strong passion and efforts, I am proud to be a synthetic biologist who contributes to society.

: There were many difficulties due to restrictions on meeting team members online, but I was able to think a lot about synthetic biology for two years. Thank you to all the team members and I hope we can prepare hard for the rest of the year and get good results.
