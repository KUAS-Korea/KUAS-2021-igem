1. Participation in Optogenic Conference by NYCU_Taipei.


3. Collaborations with Yonsei-University iGEM Team

Another iGEM participating team in Korea, Yonsei University, collaborated twice on 7/24 10PM and 8/8 9PM. As the number of Korean teams participating in iGEM with interest in synthetic biology is small, it was a good opportunity to meet and talk with more diverse people who are interested in synthetic biology. Both teams shared their promotion videos, discussed each team's progress and topics, and gave feedback.
