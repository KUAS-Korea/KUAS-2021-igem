We conducted webinars for undergraduate students at Korea University to discuss the overall contents of synthetic biology such as definition or related studies with our research this year. Since the study of synthetic biology is still unfamiliar in Korea, it was a valuable time to introduce and publicize its contents. Zoom was used because it was difficult to proceed face-to-face with COVID-19, and various educational tools were studied to improve understanding and efficiency in this process. We will continue to make efforts to further revitalize the webinar so that it can encompass more diverse students beyond Korea University.

The first webinar discussed the basic definition and actual case of synthetic biology with this year's project. As participants from various majors are gathered to agonize our topics and learn synthetic biology, we were able to gain insight into breaking the stationary framework. We led participants to express their own opinions on synthetic biology issues and aimed to ensure them could continue this academic communication in next upcoming webinar program and online community.

The most crucial discussion topic was regarding Kill Switch, and we were so inspired to make the participants understand those concepts with mutual development by gaining insights. Whenever research progresses and develops, we decided to share it with the participants and promised to add opinions together. Students at Korea University, the subject of webinars is called baby tigers after the symbol, and we finished webinar by promising to roar the beneficial value of synthetic biology at the world.
