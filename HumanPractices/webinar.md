We conducted webinars for undergraduate students at Korea University to discuss the overall contents of synthetic biology such as definition or related studies with our research this year. Since the study of synthetic biology is still unfamiliar in Korea, it was a valuable time to introduce and publicize its contents. Zoom was used because it was difficult to proceed face-to-face with COVID-19, and various educational tools were studied to improve understanding and efficiency in this process. We will continue to make efforts to further revitalize the webinar so that it can encompass more diverse students beyond Korea University.

1. The Primary Webinar, the beginning of synthetic biological communication with baby tigers (2021.08.16)

The first webinar discussed the basic definition and actual case of synthetic biology with this year's project. As participants from various majors are gathered to agonize our topics and learn synthetic biology, we were able to gain insight into breaking the stationary framework. We led participants to express their own opinions on synthetic biology issues and aimed to ensure them could continue this academic communication in next upcoming webinar program and online community.

The most crucial discussion topic was regarding Kill Switch, and we were so inspired to make the participants understand those concepts with mutual development by gaining insights. Whenever research progresses and develops, we decided to share it with the participants and promised to add opinions together. Students at Korea University, the subject of webinars is called baby tigers after the symbol, and we finished webinar by promising to roar the beneficial value of synthetic biology at the world.

2. The Second Webinar, he gateway to deliver synthetic biology to a wider world beyond Korea University (2021.09.12)

The second webinar was held for previous participants from the first program and new attendees including members of Yonsei University team, our iGEM project partner. Synthetic carbon dioxide fixation and other synthetic biological concepts have been explained through video materials and pre-handouts that we have produced, and we have answered questions during this session. In the first webinar, we mostly explained the basic concepts for non-major students, but this time was a valuable moment to learn in-depth content through mutual feedback.

In addition to this year's research, we introduced studies conducted by KUAS at iGEM over the past few years and explained the synthetic biological ideas and ideas gained from them. In the process, we also shared how we were able to develop fragmentary ideas into tangible experiments and multidimensional research through partnerships with Yonsei University teams and other collaborations. We have come to think more about ways to further promote the efforts and synthetic biological values created through various trials, errors, and challenges to schools and further to Korea.
