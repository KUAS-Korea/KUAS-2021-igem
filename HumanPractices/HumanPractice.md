Human Practice

1. Periodic synthetic biology and research-related webinars

We regularly conducted webinars for undergraduate students at Korea University to discuss the overall contents of synthetic biology such as definition or related studies with our research this year. Since the study of synthetic biology is still unfamiliar in Korea, it was a valuable time to introduce and publicize its contents. We will continue to make efforts to further revitalize the webinar so that it can encompass more diverse students beyond Korea University.


The first webinar discussed the basic definition and actual case of synthetic biology with this year's project. As participants from various majors are gathered to agonize our topics and learn synthetic biology, we were able to gain insight into breaking the stationary framework. The most crucial discussion topic was regarding Kill Switch, and we were so inspired to make the participants understand those concepts with mutual development by gaining insights. Whenever research progresses and develops, we decided to share it with the participants and promised to add opinions together.


2. Collaborations with Yonsei-University iGEM Team

Another iGEM participating team in Korea, Yonsei University, collaborated twice on 7/24 10PM and 8/8 9PM. As the number of Korean teams participating in iGEM with interest in synthetic biology is small, it was a good opportunity to meet and talk with more diverse people who are interested in synthetic biology. Both teams shared their promotion videos, discussed each team's progress and topics, and gave feedback.
