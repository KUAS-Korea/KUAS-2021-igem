Human Practice

1. Periodic synthetic biology and research-related webinars

We regularly conducted webinars for undergraduate students at Korea University to discuss the overall contents of synthetic biology such as definition or related studies with our research this year. Since the study of synthetic biology is still unfamiliar in Korea, it was a valuable time to introduce and publicize its contents. We will continue to make efforts to further revitalize the webinar so that it can encompass more diverse students beyond Korea University.


The first webinar discussed the basic definition and actual case of synthetic biology with this year's project. As participants from various majors are gathered to agonize our topics and learn synthetic biology, we were able to gain insight into breaking the stationary framework. The most crucial discussion topic was regarding Kill Switch, and we were so inspired to make the participants understand those concepts with mutual development by gaining insights. Whenever research progresses and develops, we decided to share it with the participants and promised to add opinions together.


2. Interview

A. Interview with Edgardo Griffth: the Director & Founder of EVACC foundation

At 8 a.m. on October 9, 2021, KUAS held an open seminar with Mr. Griffith, EVACC Foundation representative, who strives to preserve endangered amphibians of Panama. Along with KUAS members and other participants, we were able to ask questions about his amazing conservation project. We were very excited to meet him since his story was the inspiration of our project. About how our project started, see Description.

Mr. Griffith has been interested in biology since he was young, so he majored in microbiology and parasitology in college. While only conducting research in the laboratory, he went to the field trip in 2000 and met amphibians. Since then he completely changed the direction of the study. Thanks to his original major, he was able to better understand the pathogen related to amphibians. 

EVACC initially dealt with more than 50 species of amphibians, but now it is focusing on eight species and conducting conservation activities. Among them, the two core species are Atelopus zeteki (Panamanian golden toad) and Atelopus varius (Harlequin toad). The association's ultimate goal is to preserve nature through environmental education beyond the preservation of amphibians. Through the seminar, we learned about Panama's environmental characteristics and the diversity of amphibians living there, and how EVACC was established and operated so far. We learned about the amazing evolutionary adaptations of Atelopus species to survive in the cloud forest; how the males use visual communications amist the noisy jungle, how the larvae attach themselves to rock surfaces to not get swept away in the currents and how they feed on ants to produce their skin toxins. When he told us that there are two species of snakes that feed on these poisonous toads to obtain their skin toxin and utilize it when they hunt, we were astonished of how genius nature could be. It also was a good example that got us to ponder how long these toads have been interacting with the environment and the implications of their disappearance in the wild.

After the seminar, We were able to give a brief on our project and receive feedback. He said that if the project was successfully completed, it would be of great help to the association, and thanked KUAS for its interest in the endangered toads.
Throughout the interview, Mr.Griffith emphasized the need to protect the environment a lot, and we were able to hear how much he loves amphibians and his efforts to preserve them, so it was a good opportunity for us to appreciate the .

B. Open Seminar with Prof. Matthew Fisher from Imperial College London

At 5:30p.m on October 15, 2021, KUAS held an open seminar with Prof. Matthew Fisher from Imperial College London, who deals with fungal disease epidemiology. By holding this seminar with professor who have been constantly interacting through e-mail, we learned how to deal with fungal pathogens such as Bd as well as feedback on our research. It was a valuable moment that we seriously consider the mindset as synthetic biology researcher and the future of Chytridiomycosis disease. (Interview Questions:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ravZWHqjRYwiblC0ZuxcZ_QzqVWbFrS9xuQ4K9LvbDg/edit)	

First, we shared research focus of Prof. Matthew Fisher that have changed over time. The biggest research focus was pathogenic fungi, but when professor tried to incorporate it into issues in the wild and animals he was interested in, he is now dealing with amphibian pathogen Bd mostly. Currently, most of his research is conducted in the laboratory without field trips due to pandemic, but he usually conducted field research regardless of nations. It is based on bioinformatics, and our KUAS has also decided to be more active in the field work and learn knowledge for it. As the professor told us the skills that synthetic biology researchers should prepare after COVID-19, our KUAS members will follow them. (Especially collaborative efforts during research)

Next, we discussed about the commonalities of vulnerable amphibians toward infectious diseases and its required data for observation. Data should be collected in consideration of the severity of different infections depending on the species, and we learned the differentiated method for dealing with fungal pathogens compared to other prokaryotic or viral pathogens. The professor's words that the natural recovery of Chytridiomycosis disease is not so easy have spurred our research, also we have announced projects worked so far including kill switches and received detail feedback on them.

With this open seminar, we learned the attitude we should have when looking at or directly working on synthetic biology research beyond this year's project. And after reinforcing the weak points in our research and the strengths with high sustainability, we decided to maintain partnership with professor. We hope to hold Zoom meetings in the future to share opinions on related issues, and hope that more people to feel the value of synthetic biology including our research.

3. Leaflet production that does educational role and promotion of communication channel 

In order to increase interest in synthetic biology, we have created a leaflet containing the subject of KUAS, an introduction to synthetic biology and biological safety. The reason that the form of the material is leaflet is that it is small and light so people can conveniently carry it and read it, and also we can publish more and distribute it to more people.

We have placed leaflet throughout the school so that it can be viewed by as many students as possible, and we have listed a way to contact KUAS so that many people can also reach us online and share messages. In other words, this leaflet was also used to inform our communication channels. After that, we conducted additional communication such as promoting our topic and holding a webinar through communication channels with these communication channel. 

Not only that, by placing them in the various buildings of the school, students from various fields can also read this leaflet. Students such as students who know some biology but not familiar with synthetic biology or students who are not familiar with biology can read this to learn what synthetic biology is and how it is used.

4. Let's communicate with the world through Instagram

We used 'instagram' as a way to promote the webinar, which was carried out to easily introduce synthetic biology to the public, or to inspire interest in KUAS team project.

On August 8, 2021, we started posting on the topic <panamian golden frogs are threatened by superfungus>, emphasizing the dangers of superfungus and the importance of protecting amphibians. Since then, we have been uploading about 3 articles every week. We communicated with the public about the theme of this year's project, such as introducing the conservation efforts of amphibians, and introducing endangered amphibians in addition to panamian golden frogs.

  As we actively announced the team project through SNS, even the public who did not know much about synthetic biology showed interest in our activities. We plan to think about and practice how to use SNS in various ways.
