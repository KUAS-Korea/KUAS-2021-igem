Our engineered microbes will be applied to the skin of the amphibians

# Frog skin composition 
Chytridomycosis is an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is transmitted through the skin of amphibians and has a critical effect on survival, causing rapid population decline. Amphibian skin is unique because it is physiologically active, allowing the skin to tightly regulate respiration, water, and electrolytes. It is not yet known exactly how the fungus kills amphibians but it is thought that it may cause mortality through disrupting the normal function of the skin resulting in electrolyte depletion and osmotic imbalance.

Our team plans to study focuses on the frogs of amphibians. Frog skin is composed of epidermal and dermal layers, with each layer predominantly consisting of epithelial and fibroblastic cells.The epidermal layer consists of stratum germinativum, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum, and the mucosal layer exists at the outermost part of the epidermis.

Stratum germinativum is the innermost layer of the epidermis, composed of mitotically proliferating keratinocytes, melanocytes (pigment-producing), Langerhans cells (involved in immunity) and Merkel cells (tactile receptors). It actively divides to provide new cells for skin loss due to normal exfoliation and provides Keratinocytes to the stratum spinosum, which migrate to the stratum corneum, the uppermost layer of the skin.
<br/>Stratum spinosum comprised of distinctive keratinocytes (called prickle cells). Fibrillary proteins required for desmosome formation are synthesized and keratinization begins in this layer.
<br/>Stratum granulosum consists of granular keratinocytes migrated from the stratum spinosum. These keratinocytes contain keratohyalin granules that aid in the binding of keratin filaments and also have lamellar bodies filled with lipids. These keratinocytes secrete them as they migrate from stratum spinosum to the upper layers of the epidermis. At the same time, when they reach the stratum corneum, they lose their nuclei and organelles and become corneocytes.
<br/>Stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis composed of keratinocytes and is responsible for most of the protective barrier function of the skin. The stratum corneum has 10 to 30 corneocytes layers and has a thickness of 10 to 40 μm. When the keratinocyte becomes a corneocyte, it becomes filled with keratin proteins. Corneocytes are held together through corneodesmosomes. 
<br/>The outermost mucosal layer consists of mucus, and Mucus contains several interdependent host factors including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), lysozymes and mucosal antibodies as well as microbial-community factors, including symbiotic skin bacteria producing antifungal metabolites.

# The phylogeny of mucin of different species

The tree above includes Muc19 and confirms a previous report that Muc19 is related to the fish spiggin protein (Kawahara and Nishida 2007). It is also obvious from the analysis that Muc19 is present in fishes, amphibians, and mammals, but seems to have been lost in birds. The turtle Ch. picta and the lizard An. carolinensis show evidence of a Muc19 gene. However, in the chicken and zebrafinch the Muc19 gene is missing, providing further evidence of the lack of Muc19 in birds. As a rule Muc19 proteins contain a PTS domain, but apparently there are exceptions, like in X. tropicalis. Some of the spiggins are also different from mammalian Muc19 in that they have a PTS domain together with a fourth VWD domain

Analysis of publically available RNA-Seq data (Necsulea et al. 2014 and other studies) indicates that the 26 different X. tropicalis mucin genes are expressed in one or more tissues (fig. 4A), suggesting that they are not pseudogenes or the result of misprediction. A number of RNA-Seq samples allowed us to specifically monitor the expression of mucins during embryonic development (Tan et al. 2013). The transcription of a number of mucins is initiated at a specific developmental stage (fig. 4B). For instance, Muc2D appears at stage 11, Muc5J at stage 15, whereas Muc2H, Muc5B, and Muc5H appear relatively late during development. Finally, the Muc2A gene is expressed throughout development, beginning already in the 2-cell stage.

#  Bd infection process and pathology

Exposure to Bd occurs when the defense mechanisms of the epidermis (AMP, bacteria, etc.) are insufficient. Zoospore penetrates the mucus layer, and zoosporangia developing occurs in the deeper host cell skin layer.

Generally, Bd has an endobiotic life cycle in which the fungus grows inside the host. Zoospores inhabit the skin and develop a germ tube that penetrates the host cell membrane to transfer genetic material. The distal end of the germinal tube then swells and produces a new intracellular chytrid talus and sporangium. This process is repeated, each time burrowing into deeper layers of the host's epidermis. Once fully penetrated, immature sporangia are transported to the skin surface. When the sporangia finally mature, discharge tubes release mature zoospores into the environment to infect new individuals. 

(좀 더 자세한 설명)Upon colonization of the host epidermis, the zoospores encyst; the flagellum is absorbed and a cell wall is formed. Next, the zoospore cyst germinates and develops a germ tube that invades the host epidermis. At the tip of the germtube a new sporangium arises. Subsequently, the fungus proliferates intracellularly, within the cells of the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum. Immature sporangia are carried from the deeper skin layers to the skin surface by differentiating epidermal cells. At the time sporangia have developed discharge tubes and contain mature zoospores, they finally occur in stratum corneum where the zoospores are released in the environment.
Bd can also have an epibiotic life cycle, growing on the surface of the host's skin, where the zoospores are encysted and form anucleated rhizoids. The cyst matures in a zoosporangium and releases zoospores in a matter of only four days. 

Infection is mainly associated with a mild to severe irregular thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the outermost keratinized layers of the epidermis (the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum), erosion of the stratum corneum, and increased tissue growth (hyperplasia) of the stratum spinosum which lies beneath the keratinized superficial skin layers.
Also ulceration of the skin may occur. Other pathological changes in the epidermis adjacent to the foci of infection include mild focal necrosis, intercellular edema (spongiosis), cytoplasmic degeneration with minimal to mild inflammation and vacuolation of the deeper cell layers.
