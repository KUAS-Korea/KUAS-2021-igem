The inspiration for our project started from reading the book “the sixth extinction” by Elizabeth Kolbert. In her amazing book, I(Sungwook) read stories about how human activities were posing a threat towards our wildlife and ecosystems. Among the many episodes she delivers, I was especially astonished by the fact that the amphibian disease chytridomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen B. dendrobatidis(Bd)were pushing amphibian species towards the brink of extinction. I couldn’t believe that amphibian species living in the remotest parts of the globe were being affected. The beautiful anuran Panamian golden frog(A.zeteki) were so heavily affected that they were extinct in the wild. I thought that we should feel responsibility and should provide a solution. I brought up this issue during our weekly discussion earlier this year and eventually we decided to work on this project. 

As we gathered more information, we found a research paper which claims that the origin of this pathogen is the Korean peninsula. As a South Korean team, we felt more motivated by the project. 
We soon became aware that U Florida had previously worked on the same topic in 2017. They worked on a project to produce tryptophol which is known to be effective in repressing the growth of the pathogen. However, since their project was simply producing the anti-fungal agent, we saw room for improvement especially in the biosecurity aspect. Also, as a Safety grant recipient, safety consideration largely shaped our project. 

Along with tryptophol, violacein is also known to be effective against Bd. Previous iGem projects used violacein as their focus to produce color, but we couldn’t find teams that focused on the antifungal properties of this chemical. Adopting this compound as an antifungal agent seemed like a fresh approach, so we selected this compound. Also, the visible color of the compound would make it easier for us to detect the compound in future wet lab experiments.
