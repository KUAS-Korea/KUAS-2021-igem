## Parts page update
We updated the parts involved in tryptophol synthesis(BBa_K2352015,	BBa_K2352016, BBa_K2352017,	BBa_K2352018) submitted by UFlorida. We summarized what is known about the compound from literature using 5 additional references. We hope that our update will serve as a starting point for future teams willing to work on a similar project.
### Tryptophol 
Tryptophol was used by UFlorida in 2017 as the anti fungal agent against Bd. They referenced a research on identification of chemicals proudced in supernatants of cocultures of microbes sampled from the skin of a salamander species(Plethodon cinereus)(1)     
The extracted chemicals were tested for Bd inhibition and the most potent chemical was identified by LC-MS(High Resolution-Mass Spectrometer). The results indicate this chemical is tryptophol. 
Other references also indicate the Bd inhibitory activity of tryptophol. A research co-cultured J.lividium(Bd inhibitory microbe found in some amphibians) with Bd and then separated and identified active compounds. The MIC for the two compounds Tryptophol, Violacein were determined to be 68.9uM, 1.8uM respectively(2).
Interestingly, some research indicate tryptophol as a quorum sensing compound used by fungi. (3)
Supernatants from Bd cultures grown for 5 days repressed Bd growth and when tryptophol was treated at differenct concentrations, 10, 23, 50, 100, 250, and 500 uM, and significant growth inhibition occurred at 100 uM. An autostimulatory mechanism is suggested from the fact that cultures treated with higher tryptophol produce more tryptophol and that cultures with higher density of cells express higher levels of putative ARO8 gene.
When tryptophol concentrations measured from cultures of Bd and Bsal(related pathogen) the concentrations ranged 133-652nM(bd) 1139-1251nM(bsal) respectively. This is in the nanomolar range which is much lower than the reported MIC; 68.9uM(2).

Tryptophol is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan through the Ehrlich pathway: a three-step biochemical reaction comprising transamination, decarboxylation, and reduction.(4) In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, tryptophol is Aro80pâ€™s transcription activator. Tryptophol activates the transcription factor Aro80p and, consequently, the expression of the ARO9 and ARO10 transaminase and decarboxylase genes, which results in a positive feedback loop.(5)
